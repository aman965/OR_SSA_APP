# 🚀 Enhanced Constraint System for VRP

## 📋 Overview

The Enhanced Constraint System provides robust support for complex Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) constraints, going far beyond simple vehicle count and capacity constraints. It can handle sophisticated routing requirements like node separation, grouping, multi-part constraints, and more.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 **Supported Constraint Types**

1. **Node Separation** - Nodes that cannot be on the same route
   - Example: "node 1 and node 4 should not be served together"
   - Use case: Incompatible deliveries, security restrictions

2. **Node Grouping** - Nodes that must be on the same route  
   - Example: "node 1 and node 2 should be served together"
   - Use case: Related deliveries, efficiency requirements

3. **Vehicle Assignment** - Specific nodes assigned to specific vehicles
   - Example: "node 2 should be served by vehicle 1"
   - Use case: Specialized equipment, driver expertise

4. **Route Constraints** - Distance, time, or capacity limits per route
   - Example: "each route should not exceed 50 units"
   - Use case: Driver working hours, fuel limitations

5. **Priority Constraints** - Service order preferences
   - Example: "customer 1 has high priority"
   - Use case: VIP customers, time-sensitive deliveries

6. **Multi-part Constraints** - Combinations of the above
   - Example: "minimum 2 vehicles should be used. Also, node 1 and node 2 should be served together"
   - Use case: Complex business rules

7. **Vehicle Count Constraints** - Enhanced vehicle usage requirements
   - Example: "use at least 3 vehicles and node 3 and node 4 should be on different routes"
   - Use case: Load balancing, resource utilization

### 🧠 **Intelligent Parsing System**

#### **Three-Tier Parsing Approach:**

1. **Pattern Matching** (Fastest, High Confidence)
   - Regex-based recognition of common constraint patterns
   - Instant parsing for well-known constraint formats
   - 85-95% confidence for recognized patterns

2. **LLM-Powered Parsing** (Smart, Flexible)
   - GPT-4o integration for complex constraint understanding
   - Handles natural language variations and typos
   - Provides detailed mathematical formulations

3. **Fallback Parsing** (Robust, Always Available)
   - Basic pattern recognition when LLM is unavailable
   - Ensures system continues to function

#### **Confidence-Based Routing:**
- High confidence patterns (>85%) → Direct application
- Medium confidence → LLM verification
- Low confidence → Fallback with warnings

### 🔧 **Enhanced Constraint Application**

#### **Mathematical Constraint Generation:**
- Converts natural language to PuLP optimization constraints
- Handles complex mathematical relationships
- Validates constraint feasibility

#### **Constraint Types Handled:**

```python
# Node Separation Example
# "node 1 and node 4 should not be served together"
for k in range(vehicle_count):
    prob += (
        lpSum(x[i, node1, k] for i in nodes if i != node1) + 
        lpSum(x[i, node2, k] for i in nodes if i != node2)
    ) <= 1

# Node Grouping Example  
# "node 1 and node 2 should be served together"
for k in range(vehicle_count):
    prob += (
        lpSum(x[i, node1, k] for i in nodes if i != node1) == 
        lpSum(x[i, node2, k] for i in nodes if i != node2)
    )
```
