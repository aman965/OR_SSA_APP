- **constraint_integration.py**: Integration layer
- **models.py**: Database models for VRP problems

**Enhanced Solver**: `backend/solver/vrp_solver_enhanced.py`
**Unified Frontend**: `frontend/main_unified.py`

### 2. 🔍 LLM Infeasibility Analysis (Main Branch)  
**Location**: `backend/services/gpt_services/`
- **infeasibility_explainer.py**: GPT-powered analysis of why models fail
- Integration in **scenario_builder.py** for automatic failure analysis
- Enhanced **view_results.py** with constraint display

### 3. 🔗 Integration Points

#### Frontend Integration (`frontend/pages/scenario_builder.py`)
```python
# Enhanced VRP solver with intelligent constraint parsing
solver_path = os.path.join(BACKEND_PATH, "solver", "vrp_solver_enhanced.py")

# Fallback to original solver if enhanced version not available
if not os.path.exists(solver_path):
    solver_path = os.path.join(BACKEND_PATH, "solver", "vrp_solver.py")

# OpenAI API key support for both features
env['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = api_key

# Infeasibility analysis integration
if INFEASIBILITY_EXPLAINER_AVAILABLE and lp_file_path and is_infeasible:
    analysis_result = analyze_infeasibility(scenario.id)
```

## 🚀 How Both Features Work Together

### Workflow:
1. **Constraint Input**: User enters natural language constraints
2. **NLP Processing**: System uses pattern matching + LLM fallback to parse constraints
3. **VRP Solving**: Enhanced solver applies parsed constraints to optimization model
4. **Success**: Display optimal routes with applied constraints
5. **Failure**: LLM analyzes infeasibility and suggests fixes

### Example Integration:
```
User Input: "Each vehicle can carry maximum 500kg"
↓ NLP Processing (your feature)
Constraint: {type: "capacity", value: 500, unit: "kg"}
↓ VRP Solving
Model: vehicle_capacity[v] <= 500 for all vehicles v
↓ If Infeasible
LLM Analysis: "The total demand (600kg) exceeds vehicle capacity (500kg). 
Suggestion: Increase vehicle capacity to 600kg or add more vehicles."
```

## 🎯 Combined Capabilities

### Your NLP Constraint Processing:
- ✅ Natural language constraint parsing
- ✅ Pattern matching for common constraints  
- ✅ LLM fallback for complex constraints
- ✅ Mathematical constraint conversion
- ✅ Constraint validation

### Main Branch Infeasibility Analysis:
- ✅ Automatic failure detection
- ✅ GPT-powered root cause analysis
- ✅ Intelligent suggestions for fixes
- ✅ Enhanced error reporting

### Integration Benefits:
- ✅ **Seamless User Experience**: Natural language input → Smart solving → Intelligent failure analysis
- ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: If constraint parsing fails, system gracefully degrades
- ✅ **Dual LLM Usage**: Same OpenAI key used for both constraint parsing and failure analysis
- ✅ **Enhanced Debugging**: Users get both constraint validation and failure explanations
